## Project Status
**Ready for review** — frontend built and typechecked; basic backend scaffolding included.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run locally (development)

Start backend (from `backend/`):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Start frontend (project root):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build (production)

```bash
npm run build
```

### Notes
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide values before running the backend.
- `build/` artifacts are ignored by default; CI will still produce builds for releases.

If you'd like, I can tag a release and draft a short LinkedIn post announcing the project.
